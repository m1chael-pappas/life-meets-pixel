# Life Meets Pixel — Claude Context

Public-facing geek-culture review site (games, movies, books, anime, board games, tech). Next.js 15 (App Router) + React 19 + Sanity CMS + Impact.com affiliate integration. Retro-gaming aesthetic — Press Start 2P / JetBrains Mono / VT323 fonts, 4 switchable palettes, scanline overlay, CRT hero frame, HP-bar score breakdown. Deployed on Vercel.

## Read this first

Durable project knowledge lives in the Obsidian vault at `~/Documents/ObsidianVault`. Start here, then follow links:

- [`Projects/life-meets-pixel/overview.md`](/home/michael_pappas/Documents/ObsidianVault/Projects/life-meets-pixel/overview.md) — entry point, links to everything else
- `architecture.md`, `sanity-schema.md`, `affiliate-integration.md`, `decisions.md`, `backlog.md`, `redesign-plan.md` — topic-specific notes

Cross-project conventions:
- [`Conventions/nextjs-patterns.md`](/home/michael_pappas/Documents/ObsidianVault/Conventions/nextjs-patterns.md) — App Router patterns (note: this repo uses webhook-driven `revalidatePath`, not tag-based `revalidateTag`)
- [`Stack/life-meets-pixel-stack.md`](/home/michael_pappas/Documents/ObsidianVault/Stack/life-meets-pixel-stack.md) — versions + env vars

## Write back to the vault

Any decision, convention, performance finding, or gotcha discovered during a session should be documented in the vault before the session ends — not just when asked. Update existing notes before creating new ones.

## Non-negotiable rules

- **All GROQ lives in `lib/queries.ts`.** Don't inline GROQ in components/pages (sitemap + one-off scripts excepted).
- **`components/retro/review-card.tsx` renders all 8 item types.** Don't fork per-type cards — extend `lib/mappings.ts` + `components/retro/sprites.tsx`.
- **`/api/revalidate` is gated on `REVALIDATE_SECRET`.** If you add a new Sanity `_type`, update the `switch` in `app/api/revalidate/route.ts` or edits won't reflect until the 30s cache window lapses.
- **Every affiliate surface links to `/legal/affiliate-disclosure`.** FTC + ACL requirement.
- **Studio (`studio/`) is React 18 + Sanity 3.99.** Frontend is React 19. Don't try to unify.
- **No tag-based `revalidateTag` here.** This site is CMS-driven — Sanity webhook → `revalidatePath`. Don't retrofit tag-based invalidation without a concrete reason.

## Sanity MCP

Register the hosted Sanity MCP server once per machine (OAuth — no token needed):

```
claude mcp add Sanity -t http https://mcp.sanity.io --scope user
```

After first use it'll prompt an OAuth browser flow. Use the MCP for schema introspection, data queries, and content patches — faster than maintaining one-off scripts in `scripts/`. The `SANITY_API_TOKEN` in `.env.local` is still needed for the local seed/delete scripts, but **not** for the MCP.
