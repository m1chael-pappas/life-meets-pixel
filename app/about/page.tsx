                Every review carries one number out of 10, plus a breakdown of the three to five
                things that number is made of. The breakdown matters more than the headline figure:
                a game can earn an 8 on the strength of its systems while its story sits at 6, and
                you deserve to see which half you are buying.

                <li>
                  We buy nearly everything we cover. Where a review copy, press key or early access
                  build was provided, the review says so in plain text at the top.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We say roughly how long we spent with something before scoring it, because twenty
                  hours in a roguelike and twenty hours in an RPG are not the same claim.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reviews of live service and early access titles are dated on purpose. They
                  describe the thing as it was on that date, not forever.

                Every image here is real: official key art, press kit material, storefront
                screenshots or publisher stills, credited in the caption. We do not use AI generated
                images, and we do not lift another outlet&apos;s screenshots. Trailers are embedded
                from the publisher&apos;s own channel, never from a reupload.

              <p>
                Some links to storefronts earn us a commission at no extra cost to you. They never
                affect a score, and no review is commissioned by a retailer. The full detail is in
                the <Link href="/legal/affiliate-disclosure">affiliate disclosure</Link>. Display
                advertising is served by third parties and kept out of the body of an article, and{" "}

              <p>
                We get things wrong sometimes. When we do we fix the article and say what changed,
                rather than quietly editing it. If you have spotted an error, a broken fact or a
                miscredited image, tell us on the <Link href="/contact">contact page</Link> and we
                will sort it out.

              <p>
                Reviews and news are written by named humans, and every article links to its
                author&apos;s page so you can see everything else they have written and judge their
                taste against your own. Where an article builds on reporting by another outlet, that
                outlet is linked in the text, because they did the work.
